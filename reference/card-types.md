# The seven card types

Closed set. Seven, and no eighth. Each one carries its own proof test — a thing you can check, not a
feeling about the file. Run the tests in order; first pass wins.

| # | Type | Proof test |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ENGINE** | Two or more instances read it. Change it and all of their behavior changes. |
| 2 | **BLUEPRINT** | Instances **contain** its text rather than reference it. A change reaches future copies only. |
| 3 | **INSTANCE** | It has a name an outsider recognizes — a market, a client, a product. |
| 4 | **SLOT** | A named field inside an instance, doing the same job in every instance. |
| 5 | **MARKER** | A value the machinery branches on. Signal, not content. |
| 6 | **INSTRUCTION** | It directs a human. Delete it and no run changes. |
| 7 | **SURFACE** | Someone who never opened the folder can encounter it. |

## Running the tests

**ENGINE — count the readers.** Two is the floor. One reader is not an engine, it is a file that
thing uses. The test is not "does it look central"; it is "name the second instance."

**BLUEPRINT — grep for its own text inside an instance.**

    grep -Fxf <blueprint-file> <instance-file>

If the shared exact lines include the blueprint's *own instruction lines* — the ones addressed to
whoever is filling it in — the instance is a **copy** and your edit will not reach it. A reference
would carry a path, not the instructions. **This is the check people skip**, because copy and
reference look identical from outside the file.

**INSTANCE — say the name to someone outside the project.** If they recognize it (a city, a client,
a SKU) it is an instance. If the name only means something inside the folder, it is probably a slot
or a leftover.

**SLOT — check it appears in every instance doing the same job.** Same name, same role. A field that
exists in one instance is that instance's business, not a slot. A file that exists in every instance
but has no counterpart in the blueprint and no reader in the machinery is also not a slot — say so.

**MARKER — find the branch.** Name the file and line where the machinery reads the value and does
something different because of it. **No branch, no marker.** A bracketed token that only a human
reads is content wearing a marker's clothes — that is the most common false positive in the set.

**INSTRUCTION — delete it in your head.** If no run changes, it is an instruction. This is the only
type defined by what happens when it is absent.

**SURFACE — reach it from outside.** A status code, a URL, a shared link. "It's in a public repo" is
not the test; the test is that someone who never opened the folder can encounter it.

## The refusal

**A noun that fails all seven gets no card.** It gets one line in `notes.md` — path, and which test
it failed last. That line is the point. Seven types applied to forty nouns should produce a handful
of cards and a page of one-liners; if everything got a card, the tests were not run.

## The ceiling

**Seven cards.** Not seven types each with a card — seven cards total, and a small territory may
deserve three. A noun that passes a type after the catalog is full does not force an eighth card: it
goes in the nearest card's Does-not-hit line, where it is more useful anyway, and gets a notes line
saying it was held at the ceiling.

Three real cards beat a fake city.

## Type is not state

These seven answer *what kind of thing is this*. Whether it is still alive is a **separate axis** —
see [`state.md`](state.md). A BLUEPRINT can be a GHOST. An INSTRUCTION can be LIVE and point at a
GHOST. Never fold the two together; the moment you do, "important-looking" starts deciding both.
