"""Refusal 1 — no photocopy — plus the card-shape requirement. Run against a map and its territory.

    python3 refusal-checks.py --map <dir containing cards/> --territory <folder the map describes>

A. Every card is smaller than what it cites (its Source path: a file's bytes, a folder's total).
B. No run of more than 200 consecutive characters appears verbatim in both a card and a file it cites.
C. Every card cites at least one path that resolves in the territory.
D. Every card carries Hits, Does not hit, and Done when. A card missing one does not ship.

Exit 0 = all checks passed. Exit 1 = at least one failed. Exit 2 = could not run (bad paths).
A territory that is not on disk yields SKIPPED for A and B and a failure for C — a map whose paths
cannot be resolved is not a map that has been checked.
